        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Born and raised in England. Found myself working retial for too many years before stumbling into a data analysis role for a branch of the British Government. During this period I ended up making several (very basic) software programs and found that I liked creating them and fixing the inevitable bugs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fast-forward 6 years and now with a new-born daughter in tow, we make the move to the US to be closer to my wife's family and to allow my daughter to grow up with her cousins, 2 of which were born within weeks of her. The decision is made for me to be the stay-at-home parent. To keep me occupied and to generate some more income, my online store selling Lego parts that had been a hobby in the UK is now made into a full-time business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another 7 years later and it is now time to move on again and grow the love I found for software developing into a new career. A Grand Circus bootcamp was reccomended by a family member, and here we now are.
